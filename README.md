# MongoDB Demo for Insurance Sector

This project aims at demonstrating the usage of MongoDB in the insurance sector. It demonstrates three major use cases that are in production in the top financial services comapanies:

The following core capabilites of MongoDB are demonstrated:

* Flexible Data Model
* Data Ingestion from relational sources
* ...

The project is work in progress.

For the purpose of simplicity, there are certain assumptions that are also the basis for next steps:
* Customers are the same in both systems. Future work can include fuzzy matching as outlined in the
