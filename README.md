# MongoDB Demo for Insurance Sector

MongoDB is used by many large organizations to build mission-critical applications - increasing developer productivity, de-risking development phases and therefore enabling companies to leverage data and technology for competitive advantage.

This project aims at demonstrating the usage of MongoDB in the insurance sector. A large-scale example of unifying more than 100 million individual customers is [MetLife](https://www.mongodb.com/customers/metlife): a working prototype has been built in just two weeks, three months later the project has been in production. This demonstration explains three major use cases:

* **Mainframe Offloading:** Release legacy mainframes from MIPS intensive workloads by offloading data and processes to a modern scalable data layer allowing you to reduce cost and enable new use cases demanded by business.
* **Single View of your business:** Centralize, organize and present your business relevant information from various sources and channels to serve the business demands like 360 customer view, Single source of Risk or centralized governance.
* **Legacy Modernization:** Address the range of new business requirements and modernize in an agile, highly efficient, scalable & timely manner.

The following core capabilites of MongoDB are demonstrated:

* Flexible Data Model
* Data Ingestion from relational sources
* ...

The project is work in progress.

## Demo Overview

The demo is around an insurance company that runs home insurances and car insurances. Both are maintained in different systems. In order to leverage a new customer-facing mobile app "My Insurance App", they need to create a single view first that is able to not just integrate the data, but also handle high loads and a global, always-on deployment.

For the purpose of simplicity, there are certain assumptions that are also the basis for next steps:
* Customers are the same in both systems. Future work can include fuzzy matching as outlined in the
